In today's world, the cost of prescription, various medical commodities have been increasingly high and sometimes it is not possible for the common man to afford. While there are many non-profit orgs, we would like to track and dig deeper and help to get the least cost diagnosis for anyone aspiring for.

1) Analyze the current costs for various diseases, surgeries that are being charged today as a part of all the orgs (government / private) hospitals.
2) Using MicrosoftGraph to compute the least cost locale (hospital) for a person with the particular issue.
3) Use Graph if possible to connect the patient in emergency (atleast the phone number) to a doctor who can immediately consult
4) Make an ML model to analyze the stroke deaths that have happened within seconds and try to come up with an approach that will prevent the same / give a solution for the same.
5) Use Azure, Graph and try making a GPT that resembles the ChatGPT but this time for the health care industry called HealthGPT / DoctorGPT.

I am not sure how many of the above points can be covered in the given time range.
